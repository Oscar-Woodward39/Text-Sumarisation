Its syntax is put together from constructs borrowed from a variety of other languages; most prominent are influences from ABC, C, Modula-3 and Icon. The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C. Python is also suitable as an extension language for highly customizable C applications such as editors or window managers. Python is available for various operating systems, amongst which several flavors of UNIX (including Linux), the Apple Macintosh O.S., MS-DOS, MS-Windows 3.1, Windows NT, and OS/2. This reference manual describes the syntax and ``core semantics'' of the language. It is terse, but attempts to be exact and complete. The semantics of non-essential built-in object types and of the built-in functions and modules are described in the Python Library Reference. For an informal introduction to the language, see the Python Tutorial.\n",
